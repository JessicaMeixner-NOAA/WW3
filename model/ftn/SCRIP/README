If the user does not want to bother with SCRIP, this is fine. 

Here are the two choices:
 1) User omits "SCRIP" from switch file, then
     o user can ignore /SCRIP/ directory (i.e. does not need to run make in /SCRIP/) and may even remove it (though there is little reason to remove it since files in it are not large)
     o WW3 build system will not attempt to link in .o files from /SCRIP/
     o if user subsequently tries to run multi-grid and irregular grids at the same time, WW3 will give an error, as appropriate
 2) User includes "SCRIP" in switch file, then
     o user must run make in /SCRIP/ prior to building WW3 (i.e. WW3 build system will not compile SCRIP) using a compiler consistent with the compiler specified in comp
     o user must verify that his/her comp file includes the SCRIP directory in the search path by including, e.g. -I$path_S in "opt". This change has already been made to comp.Portland, comp.gnu
     o WW3 build system will link in .o files from /SCRIP/
     o WW3 build system will recognize dependencies on /SCRIP/, insofar as if .o files in /SCRIP/ are newer than wmgridmd.o, the build system will recompile wmgridmd etc.
     o user will be able to run multi-grid and irregular grids at the same time

Note that in both cases, the /SCRIP/ directory will exist in /ftn/, but in the first case, the user can ignore it.

reminder: "makefile" in scrip should use compile method consistent with comp file. Consistency in the compile flags are not critical (e.g. fastsse vs O4) but using two different compilers (e.g. gfortran vs. pgf90) WW3 vs. SCRIP is very likely to cause problems....

See also ../../multigrid.dev.notes.txt 

Also note that in the pgf90 example in the makefile, I have set the netcdf path to /home/rogers/netcdf/ ...this is of course something that other users would need to modify prior to running make.
