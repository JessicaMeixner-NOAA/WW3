\noindent
This wave model program requires and produces a plethora of input and output
files consistent with those of {\file ww3\_shel} in \para\ref{sec:ww3shel},
where file extensions {\file .ww3} are replaced by an identifier for a
specific grid. Note that all files are opened by name, and that the unit
number assignment is dynamic and automatic.
