\noindent
The implementation of this scattering term is work in progress, and generally 
follows the approach of \cite{art:MM06}. The first implementation here is based on \cite{art:KM08}, 
using 1D propagation, the rate of attenuation in the initial direction is given by a 
parameter $\alpha_{s}$. The present implementation is thus not conservative and is only here 
to test the consistency with other models. A conservative correction will be implemented shortly.
