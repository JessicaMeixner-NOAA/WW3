BYDRZ (Babanin/Young/Donelan/Rogers/Zieger) version implements\linebreak
observation-based physics for deep-water source/sink terms. These include wind input
source term, and sink terms due to negative wind input, whitecapping
dissipation and wave-turbulence interactions (swell dissipation).
The wind input and whitecapping dissipation source terms are based on
measurements taken at Lake George, Australia; wave-turbulence dissipation
on laboratory experiments and field observations of swell decay; negative
input on laboratory testing. Constraint is imposed on the total wind
energy input through the wind stress, known independently.

\paragraph{Wind input.} Apart from first direct field measurements
of the wind input under strong wind forcing,  the Lake George experiment
revealed a number of new physical features for wind-wave exchange,
previously not accounted for:
(i) full air-flow separation that leads to a relative reduction of
wind input for conditions of strong winds/steep waves;
(ii) dependence of the wave growth rate on wave steepness,
which signifies nonlinear behaviour of the wind-input source function;
(iii) enhancement of input in the presence of wave breaking
\citep{art:Dea06,art:Bea07} (the last feature was not implemented in BYRDZ).
Following \citet{art:RBW12}, this input source term is formulated as
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{in}(k,\theta) & = & \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_w}\, \sigma\,\gamma(k,\theta)\,N(k,\theta) \:\:\: ,
\label{eq:ST601} \\ \gamma(k,\theta) &=& G\,\sqrt{B_n}\,W \:\:\: ,
\label{eq:ST602} \\
G                &=& 2.8-\Bigl (1+\tanh (10\sqrt{B_n}W-11) \Bigr) \:\:\: ,
\label{eq:ST603} \\
B_n              &=& A(k)\,N(k)\sigma\,k^3 \:\:\: ,
\label{eq:ST604} \\
W                &=& \left (\frac{U}{c}\,-\,1 \right )^2 \:\:\: .
\label{eq:ST605}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
In (\ref{eq:ST601})$-$(\ref{eq:ST605}) $\rho_a$ and $\rho_w$ are densities
of air and water, respectively, $U$ is wind speed, $c$ refers to 
wave phase speed, $\sigma$ is radian frequency and $k$
is wavenumber. The spectral saturation (\ref{eq:ST604}), introduced
by \citet{art:Phi84}, is a spectral measure of steepness $ak$.  The
omni-directional action density is obtained by integration over all directions:
$N(k)=\int N(k,\theta)d\theta$.\linebreak
The inverse of the directional spectral narrowness $A(k)$ is defined as\linebreak
$A^{-1}(k) =$ $\int_{0}^{2\pi} [{N(k,\theta)}/{N_{\max}(k)}] d\theta$,
where $N_{\max}(k)=\max\bigl \{N(k,\theta)\bigr \}$, for all
directions $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ \citep{art:BS87}.

\citet{art:Dea06} parameterized the growth rate (\ref{eq:ST602}) in terms
of winds 10\,m above the mean surface. Wave models typically employ friction
velocity $u_\star=\tau/\rho_a$. Wind speed scaling $U=28 u_\star$ is adopted 
from \citet{art:Sea81} and \citet{art:KHH84} following equation (\ref{eq:Snyder}).
\begin{eqnarray}
W_1 & = & \mathrm{max}^2 \left \{ 0,\frac{U}{c}\ \cos(\theta-\theta_w)-1
\right \} \:\:\: , \label{eq:ST606-1} \\
W_2 & = & \mathrm{min}^2 \left \{ 0,\frac{U}{c}\ \cos(\theta-\theta_w)-1
\right \} \:\:\: .\label{eq:ST606-2} 
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
The directional distribution of $W$ is implemented as the sum of favourable
winds (\ref{eq:ST606-1}) and adverse winds (\ref{eq:ST606-2}), so that they
complement one another (i.e. $W=\{W_1\cup W_2$\}, see {\it Negative Input} 
later this section):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST606}
W=W_1-a_0\,W_2  \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Wind input constraint.} One important part of the input is the
calculation of the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean,
which must agree with the flux received by the waves. Close to the surface,
the stress $\vec{\tau}$ can be written as the sum of the viscouse and
wave-supported stress: $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\tau}_{v} + \vec{\tau}_{w}$.
The wave-supported stress $ \vec{\tau}_{w}$ is used as the principal
constraint for the wind input and cannot exceed the total stress
$\vec{\tau} \le \vec{\tau}_{tot}$.  Here the total stress is determined
by the flux parameterization: $\vec{\tau}_{tot}=\rho_a u_\star|u_\star|$.
The wave-supported stress $\tau_w$ can be calculated by integration over
the wind-momentum-input function:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST609}
   \vec{\tau}_w = \rho_w g \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{k_{max}}
   \frac{S_{in}(k^\prime,\theta)}{c} \Bigl (\cos\theta,\sin\theta \Bigr )
   dk^\prime d\theta \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent
Computation of the wave-supported stress (\ref{eq:ST609}) includes the
resolved part of the spectrum up to the highest discrete wavenumber $k_{max}$,
as well as the stress supported by short waves. To account for the latter,
an $f^{-5}$ diagnostic tail is assumed beyond the highest frequency in the
energy density spectrum. In order to satisfy the constraint and in the case
of $\vec{\tau} > \vec{\tau}_{tot}$, a wavenumber dependent factor $L$ is
applied to reduce energy from the high frequency part of the spectrum:
$S_{in}(k^\prime)=L(k^\prime)\,S_{in}(k^\prime)$ with

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST610}
L(k^\prime) = \min \Bigl \{ 1, \exp \bigl ( \mu\,[1- U/c] \bigr ) \Bigr
\}  \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent
The reduction (\ref{eq:ST610}) is a function of wind speed and phase speed and
follows an exponential form designed to reduce energy from the discrete part
of the spectrum. The strength of reduction is controlled by coefficient $\mu$,
which has a greater impact at high frequencies and only little impact on the
energy-dominant part of the spectrum. The value of $\mu$ is dynamically
calculated by iteration at each integration time step \citep{art:Tea10}.

For the drag coefficient, parameterization (\ref{eq:ST607}) was selected and
implemented as switch {\code FLX4}. The parameterization was proposed by
\citet{art:Hwa11} and accounts for saturation, and even decline 
for extreme winds, of the sea drag at wind speeds in excess of 30\,m~s$^{-1}$.
To prevent $u_\star$ from dropping to zero at very strong winds
($U_{10}\ge50.33$m~s$^{-1}$) expression (\ref{eq:ST607}) was modified to yield
$u_\star=2.026$m~s $^{-1}$. {\it Important!} In BYDRZ, bulk adjustment to any
uniform bias in the wind input field is done in terms of the wind stress
parameter $u_\star$ rather than $U_{10}$. In order to achieve that, the
factor in expression $C_d \times 10^4$ on the left hand side of
(\ref{eq:ST607}) was substituted with $C_d \times \mathrm{FAC}$ and added
as the namelist parameter {\code \&FLX4 CDFAC} (see {\it Bulk Adjustment}
at the end of this section).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST607}
C_d \times 10^4 = 8.058 + 0.967 U_{10} - 0.016 U_{10}^2 \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent
For the viscous drag coefficient equation (\ref{eq:ST608}) is selected which
was parameterized by \citet{art:Tea10} as a function of wind speed by using
data from \citet{art:BP98}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST608}
  C_v \times 10^3 = 1.1 - 0.05 U_{10} \:\:\: .
\end{equation}


\paragraph{Negative Input.} Apart from the positive input, BYDRZ also has
negative input term in order to attenuate growth of waves in those parts
of wave spectrum where adverse component of the wind stress is present
(\ref{eq:ST606-1}--\ref{eq:ST606-2}). The growth rate for adverse winds
is negative \citep{pro:Don99} and is applied after the constraint of
the wave-supported stress $\tau_w$ is met. The value of $a_0$
(in \ref{eq:ST606}) is a tuning parameter in the parameterization of the
input and is adjustable through namelist parameter {\code \&SIN6 SINA0}.



\noindent
\paragraph{Whitecapping Dissipation.} For dissipation due to wave breaking,
the Lake George field study revealed a number of new features: (i) the
threshold behaviour of wave breaking \citep{art:BBY01}. The waves do not
break unless they exceed a generic steepness in which case the wave breaking
probability depends on the level of excedence above this threshold steepness.
For waves below the critical threshold, whitecapping dissipation is zero.
(ii) the cumulative dissipative effect due to breaking and dissipation of
short waves affected by longer waves 
\citep{pro:Don01,pro:BY05,art:Mea06,art:YB06,art:Bea10},
(iii) nonlinear dissipation function at strong winds
(\citeauthor{art:Mea06}, \citeyear{art:Mea06};\linebreak
 \citeauthor{art:Bea07}, \citeyear{art:Bea07}),
(iv) bimodal distribution of the directional spreading of the dissipation
\citep{art:YB06,art:Bea10} (the last feature was not implemented in BYRDZ).
Following \citet{art:RBW12}, the whitecapping dissipation term is
implemented as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST620}
  S_{ds}(k,\theta) = \Bigl [ T_1(k,\theta) + T_2(k,\theta) \Bigr ]\ N(k,\theta) \:\:\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $T_1$ is the inherent breaking term, expressed as the traditional function
of wave spectrum, and $T_2$, expressed as an integral of the wave spectrum below
wavenumber $k$, accounts for the cumulative effect of short-wave breaking or
dissipated due to longer waves at each frequency/wavenumber. The inherent breaking
term $T_1$ is the only breaking-dissipation term if this frequency is at or below
the spectral peak. Once the peak moves below this particular frequency, $T_2$
becomes active and progressively more important as the peak downshifts further.


The threshold spectral density $F_{\mathrm{T}}$ is calculated as shown in
(\ref{eq:ST621}), where $k$ is the wavenumber and with
$\varepsilon_{\mathrm{T}}=0.035^2$ being the empirical constant
\citep{art:Bea07,bk:Bab11}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST621}
  F_{\mathrm{T}}(k)=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{T}}}{A(k)\,k^3} \:\:\: . 
\end{equation}

\noindent
Let the level of exceedence above the critical threshold spectral density (at
which stage wave breaking is predominant) be defined as
$\Delta(k)=F(k)-F_{\mathrm{T}}(k)$. Furthermore, let $\mathcal{F}(k)$ be a
generic spectral density used for normalization, then the inherent breaking
component can be calculated as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST622}
T_1(k)=a_1 A(k)\frac{\sigma}{2\pi} \left [ \frac{\Delta(k)}{\mathcal{F}(k)}
\right ]^{p_1} \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent
The cumulative dissipation term is not local in frequency space and is 
based on an integral that grows towards higher frequencies, dominating at 
smaller scales:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST623}
T_2(k)=a_2 \int\limits_0^k A(k) \frac{c_g}{2\pi} \left [
\frac{\Delta(k)}{\mathcal{F}(k)} \right ]^{p_2}\!\!dk \:\:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent
The dissipation terms (\ref{eq:ST622})$-$(\ref{eq:ST623}) depend on five
parameters: a generic spectral density $\mathcal{F}(k)$ used for
normalization, and four coefficients $a_1$, $a_2$, $p_1$, and $p_2$.  The
coefficients $p_1$ and $p_2$ control the strength of the normalised threshold
spectral density $\Delta(k)/\mathcal{F}(k)$ of the dissipation terms.
Namelist parameter {\code SDSET} changes between the spectral density
$F(k)$ and threshold spectral density $F_{\mathrm{T}}(k)$ for
normalization in (\ref{eq:ST622})--(\ref{eq:ST623}).
According to \citet{art:Bea07} and \citet{art:Bab09}, the directional
narrowness parameter is set to unity $A(k)\approx 1$ in equations
(\ref{eq:ST621})$-$(\ref{eq:ST623}).

\label{tab:ST601} \botline \end{table}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------

\citet{art:RBW12} calibrated the dissipation terms based on duration-limited
academic tests. Calibration coefficients used in BYRDZ and listed in
Table~\ref{tab:ST601} differ somewhat from those of \citet{art:RBW12}
mainly due to the fact that the wave-supported stress $\vec{\tau}_w$
is implemented in the form of vector components and the scaling model
for wind speed is customisable in the wind input parameterization.

\paragraph{Swell Dissipation.} In the absence of wave breaking,
other mechanisms of wave attenuation are present. Here, they are
referred to as swell dissipation and parameterized in terms of
the interaction of waves with oceanic turbulence \citep{bk:Bab11}.
This mechanism, however, remains active for the wind-generated
waves too. Its contribution across the spectrum is small, if the
spectrum is above the wave-breaking threshold, but it is dominant
at the front face of the spectrum, or even at the peak in case of
the full Pierson-Moscowitz development. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST624}
  S_{swl}(k,\theta) = -\frac{2}{3}b_1 \sigma\ \sqrt{B_n}\ N(k,\theta) \:\:\:.
\end{equation}

\noindent
By making coefficient $b_1$ in equation (\ref{eq:ST624}) dependent
on steepness the large gradient in the spatial bias in wave height
can be reduced:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST625}
   b_1 = B_1 \, 2\sqrt{E}\,k_p \:\:\:.
\end{equation}

In equation (\ref{eq:ST625}), $B_1$ is a scaling coefficient,
$E$ (\ref{eq:etot}) is the total sea surface variance  and $k_p$
is the peak wavenumber.  Equation (\ref{eq:ST625}) can be
flagged through namelist parameter {\code \&SWL6 CSTB1}.The value for the
coefficient $B_1$ in (\ref{eq:ST625}) and/or $b_1$ in (\ref{eq:ST624})
is customizable through namelist parameter {\code \&SWL6 SWLB1}
(see Table~\ref{tab:ST601}).

\noindent
\paragraph{Bulk Adjustments.} The source term
{\code ST6} has been calibrated with flux parameterization {\code FLX4}.
Bulk adjustment to the wind filed can be achieved by re-scaling the drag
parameterization {\code FLX4} through namelist parameter {\code
\&FLX4 CDFAC=1.0E-4}.  This has a similar effect to tuning variable
$\beta_{max}$ in {\code ST4} source term package, equations
(\ref{eq:SinWAM4}) and (\ref{eq:tauhfint}), which is customizable
through namelist parameter {\code BETAMAX} (see section
\ref{sec:ST3}--\ref{sec:ST4}). \citet{pro:Aea11} and \citet{art:RA13}
listed different sets of values that allow us to adjust to different
wind fields. When optimizing the wave model, it is recommended to
only re-tune parameters $a_0$, $b_1$ and $\mathrm{FAC}$. Again, $\mathrm{FAC}$
can potentially eliminate a bias in the wind field, which typically changes
with the selection of the reanalysis product. This reduction was tested
for extreme wind conditions such as hurricanes \citep{art:ZBRY15}.  In global
hindcast, the coefficient for the negative input can be used to tune
the bulk of wave height in scatter comparisons, whereas the scaling
coefficient for swell dissipation primarily effect large sea states.
When discrete interactive approximation (DIA) is used to compute the four-wave
interaction the default value for the proportionality constant changes to
$C=3.00\;10^7$.

\textrm{\textit{\underline{Limitations of the code:}}} In cases where the
minimum time step for dynamical source term integration is much smaller
than the overall time step (i.e. less than 1/15th) the model becomes unstable.
The issue is known and will be removed in a future revision.
