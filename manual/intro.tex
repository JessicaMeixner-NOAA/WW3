\subsection{~About this manual}
\vssub

This is the user manual and system documentation of version \WWver\ of the
 third-generation wind-wave modeling framework \ww. This underlying model has
 been developed at the Marine Modeling and Analysis Branch (MMAB) of the
 Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) of the National Centers for Environmental
 Prediction (NCEP). It is based on WAVEWATCH~I and WAVEWATCH~II as developed
 at Delft University of Technology, and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
 respectively. \ws\ differs from its predecessors in all major aspects; i.e.,
 governing equations, program structure, numerical and physical
 approaches. %\wt\ is a trademark of the United States government.

This manual describes the governing equations, numerical approaches,
compilation, and running of \ws. The format of a combined user manual and
system documentation has been chosen, to give users the necessary background
to include new physical and numerical approaches in the framework according to
their own specifications.  This approach became more important, as \ws\
developed into a wave modeling framework. By design, a user can apply his or
her numerical or physical approaches, and thus develop a new wave model based
on the \ws\ framework. In such an approach, optimization, parallelization,
nesting, input and output service programs from the framework can be easily
shared between actual models.  Whereas this document is intended to be
complete and self-contained, this is not the case for all elements in the
system documentation. For additional system details, reference is made to the
source code, which is fully documented. Note that a best practices guide for
code development for \ws\ is now available \citep{tol:MMAB09b}.

The governing equations and numerical approaches used in this model are
described in chapters~\ref{chapt:eq} and \ref{chapt:num}. Running the model is
described in chapter~\ref{chapt:run}. Installing \ws\ is described in
chapter~\ref{chapt:impl}. Finally, a short system documentation is given in
chapter~\ref{chapt:sys}. A thorough knowledge of \ws\ can be obtained by
following chapters~\ref{chapt:eq} through \ref{chapt:impl}. A shortcut is to
first install the model (chapter~\ref{chapt:impl}), and then successively
modify input files in example runs (chapter~\ref{chapt:run}).

The present model version (\WWver) is a developmental version based on the
last official model release (version 3.14). Since the latter release the
following modifications have been made:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\rightmargin 5mm \parsep 0mm \itemsep 0mm}

\item
The code is now maintained using subversion \citep{bk:CSea06}. For
co-developers, a script is available to install \ws\ directly from the
repository at NCEP \citep[see][]{tol:MMAB09b} (model version 3.14/4.00).

%A note of caution. \ws\ includes wave-current interactions. The implementation
%of these interactions has only been tested in idealized test cases. Only
%limited tests in realistic conditions have been performed.
%
% Note from FA: SHOM and Ifremer have been using it routinely with currents and water levels for 
% forecasts. There used to be a few bugs but they have now been fixed, and the result improvement is
% spectacular. We are now investigating the details, and things may still be a bit strange close to blocking 
% conditions, but not worse than other things (spectral shapes in shallow water ...) So I think this 
% note of caution can be removed. 

\vspace{\baselineskip} \noindent 
Up to date information on this model can be found (including bugs and bug
fixes) on the \ws\ web page, and comments, questions and suggestions should be
directed to the corresponding E-mail address

We will redirect questions regarding contributions from outside NCEP to the
respective authors of the codes.

required to offer same to NOAA for inclusion under the instant licensing terms
with NOAA's licensed software along with documentation regarding its
principles, use and its advantages.  This includes changes to the wave model
proper including numerical and physical approaches to wave modeling, and
boundary layer parameterizations embedded in the wave model The Licensee is
encouraged but not obligated to provide pre-and post processing tools for
model input and output.  The software required to be offered shall not include
additional models to which the wave model may be coupled, such as oceanic or
atmospheric circulation models. The software provided by the Licensee shall be
consistent with the latest model version available to the Licensee, and
interface routines to the software provided shall conform to programming
standards as outlined in the model documentation. The software offered to NOAA
shall be offered as is, without any warranties whatsoever and without any
liability for damages whatsoever.  NOAA shall not be required to include a
Licensee's software as part of its software.  Licensee's offered software
shall not include software developed by others.

A Licensee may reproduce sufficient software to satisfy its needs.  All copies
shall bear the name of the software with any version number as well as
replicas of any applied copyright notice, trademark notice, other notices and
credit lines.  Additionally, if the copies have been modified, e.g. with

\subsection{~Acknowledgments}
\vssub

The development of \ws\ has been an ongoing process for well over a
decade. The development of WAVEWATCH I was entirely funded through my
Ph.D. work at Delft University. The development of WAVEWATCH II has been
funded entirely through my position as a National Research Council Resident
Research Associate at NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center. The initial
development of WAVEWATCH III version 1.18 was entirely funded by NOAA/NCEP,
with most funding provided by the NOAA High Performance Computing and
Communication (HPCC) office. Developments of version 2.22 have been funded
similarly through NOAA/NCEP. Since then, funding is provided by NCEP, but also
by many partners outside NCEP. Much of the work at NCEP has been performed
under contract by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
Special thanks are due to to The Office of Naval Research (ONR), for the
funding of many upcoming model upgrades.

I would finally like to thank all users who have reported errors and glitches,
or have made suggestions for improvements, particularly those who have
beta-tested this and previous model release.
