\subsection{~The development group}
\vssub

Even in its original development, when I was working on the code mostly on my
own on the development of \ws, many have contributed to the success of the
model. With the expansion of physical and numerical parameterizations
available, the list of contributors to this model is growing. I would like to
recognize the following contributors as the development group (in alphabetic
order) :

\begin{list}{\ldots}{ }
