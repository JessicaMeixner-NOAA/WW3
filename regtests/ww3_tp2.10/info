# - This is a simplified version of the SMC0512 grid (to be introduced in   #
#   cases), covering the Lake Erie only for a quick regression test.        #
#   Corresponding input files are labeled with id 'Erie'.                   #
#                                                                           #
#   Output is converted into text files by ww3_outf as type 4 output, which #
#   is added as a new type for all sea points.  Plotting of the output is   #
#   achieved with a proper projection method with the help of the cell      #
#   information file  ErieSMCel.dat and the grid parameters stored in       #
#   ww3_grid.inp.  IDL scripts for plotting SMC grid output is available on #
#   until a solution is agreed to add them into the WW3 package as a post-  #
#   procession tool.  Regular grid at the base resolution is also possible  #
#   as type 3 for instance but the refined cells are merged into base       #
#   resolution regular grid ones.                      #
#                                                                           #
